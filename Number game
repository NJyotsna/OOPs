Java code for playing a number game in which we try to guess the number randomly generated by the computer.

CODE:

import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberGame {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
       Random random = new Random();
       int numberOfRounds = 0;
       int numberOfCorrectGuesses = 0;
       int attemptsPerRound = 0;
       int maxAttempts = 10;
       while (true) {
           int secretNumber = random.nextInt(100) + 1;
           System.out.println("Guess the number between 1 and 100. You have " + maxAttempts + " attempts.");
           int userGuess;
           int attempts = 0;
           boolean isCorrect;
           do {
               System.out.println("Enter your guess:");
               userGuess = scanner.nextInt();
               attempts++;
               attemptsPerRound++;
               isCorrect = userGuess == secretNumber;
               if (isCorrect) {
                   System.out.println("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in " + attempts + " attempts.");
                   numberOfCorrectGuesses++;
                   break;
               } else if (attempts == maxAttempts) {
                   System.out.println("Sorry, you didn't guess the correct number. The number was " + secretNumber + ".");
                   break;
               } else if (userGuess > secretNumber) {
                   System.out.println("Your guess is too high. Try again.");
               } else {
                   System.out.println("Your guess is too low. Try again.");
               }
           } while (true);
           numberOfRounds++;
           System.out.println("Do you want to play again? (yes/no)");
           String playAgain = scanner.next();
           if (!playAgain.equalsIgnoreCase("yes")) {
               break;
           }
       }
       double score = (double) numberOfCorrectGuesses / numberOfRounds * 100;
       System.out.println("Your score is " + score + "%. You played " + numberOfRounds + " rounds and guessed correctly " + numberOfCorrectGuesses + " times.");
   }
}
